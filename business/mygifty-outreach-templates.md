## Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Quick idea for [Clinic Name] patient retention

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Clinic Name] has amazing reviews — your patients clearly love you.

Quick question: do you do anything special for patient birthdays or after major treatments? 

We help dental practices like yours turn one-time patients into lifelong fans through thoughtful, personalized gifts — delivered automatically, no extra work for your team.

Would love to share how it works. Worth a quick chat?

Best,
Sasha

## Email 2: Follow-up (3 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Quick idea for [Clinic Name]

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note — I know you're busy running a practice!

One dental office we work with sends a small gift box after every Invisalign completion. Their Google reviews went up 40% in 3 months.

If patient loyalty is on your radar, I'd love to show you how we make it effortless.

5-minute call this week?

Best,
Sasha

## Email 3: Break-up (5 days later)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I've reached out a couple times about helping [Clinic Name] with patient gifting — no worries if it's not a fit right now.

I'll assume the timing isn't right unless I hear back. But if you ever want to explore this, just reply to this email.

Wishing you and your team continued success!
